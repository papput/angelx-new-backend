# AngelX Cryptocurrency Exchange API

This is the backend API for the AngelX cryptocurrency exchange platform, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features

- User authentication with phone number and OTP
- Cryptocurrency exchange functionality (USDT to INR)
- Deposit and withdrawal management
- Admin dashboard for managing users and transactions
- Real-time exchange rates from CoinGecko
- Secure JWT-based authentication

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- 2Factor.in API key for OTP service

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Angelx-NodeJs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
4. Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
   - Set your `OTP_API_KEY` from 2Factor.in
   - Configure your MongoDB connection
   - Set your JWT secret

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Endpoints

See [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed API documentation.

## OTP Authentication Flow

AngelX uses phone number and OTP for user authentication with database session storage:

1. User sends their phone number to `/api/v1/auth/login`
2. System sends OTP via 2Factor.in SMS API and stores session ID in database
3. User receives OTP on their phone and sends it to `/api/v1/auth/verify-otp`
4. System retrieves session ID from database and verifies OTP with 2Factor API
5. If OTP is valid, user receives a JWT token for authentication

## Testing

Run the comprehensive API test suite:
```bash
npm run test:flow
```

Run the OTP functionality test:
```bash
npm run test:otp
```

## Seeding Data

To seed initial data (admin user, exchange methods, etc.):
```bash
npm run seed
```

## System Overview

AngelX provides a secure platform for users to:
- Deposit fiat currency (INR) to get cryptocurrency (USDT)
- Withdraw cryptocurrency (USDT) to personal wallets
- Exchange cryptocurrency (USDT) for fiat currency (INR)
- Track transaction history and account balances

The system follows a role-based access control model with two user types:
- **Users**: Can deposit, withdraw, and exchange cryptocurrencies
- **Admins**: Can manage deposit methods, exchange rates, and verify transactions

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **API**: RESTful API design
- **Testing**: Shell scripts and JavaScript tests

## Authentication

AngelX uses JWT for authentication. There are two types of tokens:

1. **User Token**: For regular users to access their accounts
2. **Admin Token**: For administrators to manage the platform

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Login**:
   - User sends phone number to `/api/v1/auth/login`
   - System sends OTP (in production) or simulates it in development
   - User verifies OTP at `/api/v1/auth/verify-otp`
   - System returns JWT token

2. **Admin Login**:
   - Admin sends credentials to `/api/v1/admin/login`
   - System validates and returns admin JWT token

All protected endpoints require the appropriate token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

## Transaction Flows

### Deposit Flow

The deposit flow allows users to add cryptocurrency to their account balance by depositing fiat currency.

#### Process Steps:

1. **View Deposit Methods**:
   - User fetches available deposit methods from `/api/v1/deposit/methods`
   - System returns list of supported payment methods and their addresses

2. **Create Deposit Request**:
   - User selects a method and specifies INR amount to deposit
   - User sends request to `/api/v1/deposit/create`
   - System creates pending deposit record and returns payment details

3. **Submit Transaction ID**:
   - User makes payment using the provided method
   - User submits transaction ID to `/api/v1/deposit/submit-txid`
   - System updates deposit status to "awaiting_txid"

4. **Admin Verification**:
   - Admin checks pending deposits at `/api/v1/deposit/admin/all`
   - Admin verifies transaction (e.g., checks bank transfer)
   - Admin updates deposit status to "completed" at `/api/v1/deposit/admin/update-status/:id`
   - System converts INR to USDT using current exchange rate and credits user balance

#### Key Points:
- Users deposit fiat currency (INR) and receive cryptocurrency (USDT)
- Balance is credited only after admin approval with proper conversion
- Transaction IDs are required for verification
- Deposit methods are managed by admins

### Withdrawal Flow

The withdrawal flow allows users to transfer cryptocurrency from their account to external wallets.

#### Process Steps:

1. **Manage Wallets**:
   - User adds wallet addresses at `/api/v1/wallet/add`
   - User can view saved wallets at `/api/v1/wallet/list`

2. **Create Withdrawal Request**:
   - User selects wallet and USDT amount
   - User sends request to `/api/v1/withdraw/create` with OTP verification
   - System immediately deducts USDT amount from user balance
   - System creates pending withdrawal record

3. **Admin Processing**:
   - Admin views pending withdrawals at `/api/v1/withdraw/admin/all`
   - Admin processes withdrawal (sends cryptocurrency to user's wallet)
   - Admin updates withdrawal status to "approved" at `/api/v1/withdraw/admin/update-status/:id`
   - System creates transaction record for audit

#### Key Points:
- Balance is deducted immediately when withdrawal is created
- Status changes don't affect balance (balance already deducted)
- Transaction records are for audit purposes only

### Exchange Flow

The exchange flow allows users to convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency.

#### Process Steps:

1. **Manage Bank Accounts**:
   - User adds bank account details at `/api/v1/exchange/methods`
   - User can view saved accounts at `/api/v1/exchange/methods`

2. **Check Exchange Rate**:
   - User fetches current rate from `/api/v1/exchange/rate`
   - Admin can update rates manually or via CoinGecko API

3. **Create Exchange Request**:
   - User selects bank account and USDT amount
   - User sends request to `/api/v1/exchange/create`
   - System immediately deducts USDT from user balance
   - System creates pending exchange record with INR equivalent

4. **Admin Processing**:
   - Admin processes exchange (transfers INR to user's bank account)
   - Admin updates exchange status to "completed" at `/api/v1/exchange/admin/update-status/:id`
   - User receives fiat currency in their bank account

#### Key Points:
- Exchange rate is used to calculate INR equivalent
- USDT balance is deducted immediately upon request
- Fiat transfer is processed manually by admin
